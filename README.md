Matchday Packing List 
For this project, I developed Matchday Packing List, a React app designed to help athletes efficiently organize and pack everything they need before a game. The app ensures that all essential items are accounted for, helping users stay focused on their performance rather than worrying about missing gear.

Key Features & Enhancements:
▶ Adding Items – Easily add new items to the packing list, ensuring everything needed for matchday is included.

▶ Deleting Items Individually – Remove specific items from the list with a single click, keeping the packing list organized and clutter-free.

▶ Custom Inputs & Quantity Form – Users can enter item names and specify amounts, allowing for precise packing (e.g., "2 water bottles" or "3 pairs of socks").

▶ Sorting Items – Items can be sorted based on their name, description, or whether they are packed, making it easy to find and manage them.

▶ Packing Status – Mark items as packed or unpacked with a simple toggle, helping users track their progress and avoid leaving anything behind.

▶ Deleting All Items at Once – A reset button allows users to clear the entire list quickly, making it easy to start fresh before the next game.

Key Skills Developed:
▶ State Management – Used React’s useState hook to dynamically update the packing list, ensuring smooth interaction and reactivity.

▶ Array & Object Manipulation – Worked extensively with JavaScript arrays and objects to store, update, and remove packing list items efficiently.

▶ Sorting Techniques – Implemented sorting functionality using array methods such as .sort(), allowing users to organize their list based on name, description, or packing status.

▶ Array Methods – Leveraged essential array methods like .map(), .filter(), and .find() to handle dynamic rendering, searching, and item removal.

▶ Event Handling – Used event listeners and React's synthetic events to manage user interactions, such as button clicks and form submissions.

▶ Conditional Rendering – Applied conditional logic to dynamically display UI elements based on the list’s state, such as showing a "No items added" message when the list is empty.

This project strengthened my fundamental React knowledge, particularly in state management, data manipulation, sorting, and interactive list handling.
